THe OOCSI server can be run simply by double-clicking on the JAR file in most operating systems. There are, however, command line parameters that are explained in the following:

Port
Run the server on a specific port (instead of 4444 which is the default):

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -port 4545
Logging
Switch on logging to the console:

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -logging
Switch on logging to a file "logfile.txt":

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -logging > logfile.txt
Clients
Allow for a certain maximum number of clients to be connected (here, 55):

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -clients 55
Specify some users which are protected by a password. User and password are separated by a double-colon and different users are separated by a semicolon. You can use alphanumerical characters as well as '-', '_', '.', '$', and '%' for a password of any length. For an example with two users: Alice with her password "Pa$$word%%" and Bob with his password "bob-pas$worD":

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -users Alice:Pa$$word%%;Bob:bob-pas$worD
Of course, all parameters can be used at the same time, like this:

java -jar OOCSI_server.jar -logging -clients 55 -port 4545 -users Alice:Pa$$word%%;Bob:bob-pas$worD
